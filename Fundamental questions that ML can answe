Fundamental questions that ML can answer:

1. How many or how much of something? (regression)

2. Is this observation A or B (or C or D)? (classification)

3. What groupings exist in the data already? ( clustring)

4. What should I do next? What will likely happen next? (Time Series)

5. Is this thing weird? (anomaly detection)
