Zachs answers for the subqueries exercises

# 1

select * 
from employees
where emp_no = 101010

select * 
from employees
where hire _date = "1990-10-22";

select * 
from employees
where hire_date = (
        select *
        from employees
        where emp_no = 101010
);


# 2

select *
from employees
where first_name = "Aamod";

select title
from titles
where emp_no in
    (select emp_no
    from employees
    where first_name = "Aamod"
    );



# 3

select *
from salaries
where to_date > now();

---- how many people work at company
select count(*)
from salaries
where to_date > now();
----
---how many records are in the meployee table

select count (*)
from employees
---

answer:

SELECT (SELECT count(*)
        FROM employees) 
        -
        (SELECT count(*)
        FROM salaries
        WHERE to_date > now()
);		
		


# 4

select first_name, last_name
from employees
where emp_no in (
    select emp_no
    from dept_manager
    where to_date > now()
)
and gender = "F";

---another solution using 2 subqueries

select first_name, last_name
from employees
where emp_no in (
    select emp_no
    from dept_manager
    where to_date > now()
        and emp_no in ( 
        from employees
        where gender = "F"
        )
);


something cool:

    coalesce(select d.dept_name, 'Overall Average') as department
    avg(salary) as salary
from departments d
join dept_emp de using(dept_no)
join salaries s using (emp_no)
group by d.dept_name with rollup


# 5

select avg(salary)
from salaries;

select first_name, last_name, salary
from employees
join using(emp_no)
where to_date > now()
and salary > (
    select avg(salary)
from salaries
    );


# 6
----get max salary
--where between () and ()
select max(salary)
from salaries;

select stddev(salary)
from salaries

select * 
from salaries
where salary between (select max(salary from salaries)
--highest salary - standard deviation    
    - (select stddev(salary) from salaries))
and to_date > now()

--what percentage of all current salaries

select (select * 
from salaries
where salary between (select max(salary from salaries)
--highest salary - standard deviation    
    - (select stddev(salary) from salaries))
and to_date > now()
))
/ (select count(*) from salaries where to_date > now());
